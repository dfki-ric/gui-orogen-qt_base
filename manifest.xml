  <description brief="Base component that is aware of Qt threading requirements">
  This project's component is meant to be used as a base class for others. It
  provides hooks matching the RTT hooks, but running in the Qt main thread,
  as well as a method to synchronously "call" other methods from the RTT thread,
  to be run in the Qt thread
